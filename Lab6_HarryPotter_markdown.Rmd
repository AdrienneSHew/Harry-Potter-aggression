```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Load packages and read in data
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
hp_data<-read_csv("harry_potter_aggression_full.csv")

hp_data

```

I'm in lab week 6. 

2. Basic wrangling and make a graph of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy aggression rates
```{r}

hp_graph<-hp_data %>% 
  filter(Name=="Harry"|Name=="Draco Malfoy") %>% 
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=book, y=agg.per.mention))+
  geom_col(aes(fill=Name), position = "dodge")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()

#dodge makes them show side by side, rather than stacked

hp_graph
```

I would like to go to sleep now.
